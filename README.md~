# Crashery, an ACRA Analysis Tool

Web Site: [Crashery](http://crashery.com/)

Crashery is fun little project. It's a web app that makes sense of your [ACRA Reports] (http://publicstaticdroidmain.com/2012/01/application-crash-reporting-for-android/). 

## How do I use it?
First, make sure your ACRA spreadsheet is shared Publicly in Google Documents. If you don't know what ACRA is, [start here] (http://publicstaticdroidmain.com/2012/01/application-crash-reporting-for-android/).

It's also important that your spreadsheet columns mirror mine, which is ACRA's default. They'll need to be in the exact-same order as the sample spreadsheet on the Crashery website.

## Credits
Crashery uses some of the JavaScript from the [SMS Backup Plus] (https://github.com/jberkel/sms-backup-plus/blob/gh-pages/acra-analysis.html) project Jan Berkel.
